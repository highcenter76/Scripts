Simple scripts for use with the limitations of the built-in ash shell (BusyBox 1.33.2) on the GL.iNet GL-MT6000 'Flint 2' router.

Born of my frustration with the lack of standard/expected output and/or command options of BusyBox (like the missing -f "Don't fragment" for ping).

These scripts work with/around BusyBox limitations by keeping things simple and using alternative methods to what would otherwise be available in a full *NIX environment.

Also, a bit of play time with the python-wrapped MLB Stats API.

Big thank you to toddrob99! - https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI

My scratch is certainly NOT an example the most efficient methods or code, but it works. That's OK :-)
