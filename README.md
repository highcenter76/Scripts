Simple scripts for use with the limitations of the built-in ash shell (BusyBox 1.33.2) on the GL.iNet GL-MT6000 'Flint 2' router.

Frustrated with the lack of standard/expected output and/or command options of BusyBox (like the missing -f "Don't fragment" for ping).

These scripts creatively work with/around BusyBox limitations by keeping things simple and using alternative methods to what would otherwise be available in a full *NIX environment.

including.. a little play time with the python-wrapped MLB Stats API
Big thank you to toddrob99!

Likely NOT the most efficient methods and code. That's OK :-)
